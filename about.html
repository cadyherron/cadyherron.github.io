		<p class="inline aboutjulia"> JULIA HERRON was born and raised in Marin County, CA. She loved playing sports from a young age, and she played softball and golf througout high school. To counter what could've been a good reputation, she was also an avid chess player, even travelling to national competitions a few times. She attended UC Berkeley and studied Environmental Economics. She lived with her sister Liz in Philadelphia for a couple years, managing a lululemon store and selling fancy yoga pants. She's now a programmer for a solar energy company called Locus Energy.</p>
		<p class="inline aboutgreg"> GREGORY FLANAGAN was born and raised in Evergreen, CO. He enjoyed skiing growing up, and swam competitively throughout high school. Greg was also into chess as a young lad, winning his 4th grade chess tournament. While on a spirit quest at the age of 26, he decided to pursue his passion for computer science, which brought him to Cal Poly. After graduating, he started working in Germany and later got a job at Locus Energy. He worked there for 3 years, but has recently started a new job working at a trendy startup that creates software for drones.</p>

		<p class="normalp">GREG + JULIA met while working at Locus Energy. They started talking about music, and then discovered that they were both chess nerds. Greg has won one game so far. Greg asked Julia to marry him while they were on a hike in Portland, OR. Greg was so nervous that he later couldn't remember what he said, or that Julia had said YES!</p>
