			<p class="normalp">THE PLACE - The ceremony and reception will be held at the <a href="http://www.headlands.org/" target=blank>Headlands Center for the Arts</a>, located 10 miles North of San Francisco. The Marin Headlands was originally home to the Native American Coastal Miwok. In the 18th Century, Spanish and Mexican ranchers occupied the land, eventually giving way to Portuguese dairy farmers. In the 1890s, the first military installations were built, including the Fort Barry Buildings. In 1982, local artists rehabilitated the historic buildings into the Center for the Arts that stands today.</p>
			<p class="normalp">THE CEREMONY - The ceremony will take place at 3:30pm on September 5, 2015, at the Headlands Center for the Arts.</p>
			<p class="normalp">THE RECEPTION - The reception will also be held at the Headlands Center for the Arts. There will be a cocktail hour immediately following the ceremony, and then dinner and dancing until 10pm.</p>
			<p class="normalp">THE WEATHER - The average temperature for September is 65 degrees, and the weather could be either sunny or foggy. We recommend dressing in layers and bringing an additional jacket or scarf. You can find a 7-day weather forecast for the Headlands on the <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Sausalito" target=blank>NOAA website</a>.</p>
